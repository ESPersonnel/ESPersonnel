### ESPersonnel here ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3D artist. I'm here to showcase my learning experiences.

Currently working on learning Three.JS ('It's not that bad')

I'll be sharing my artwork once I get a website built, hence the need for Three.JS.

This is where good sites will be stored:

<ul>
  <li><a href = "https://hello-threejs-seven.vercel.app/">Hello three.js</a> - First site just happens to be a donut, Andrew Price would be so proud (Blender reference).</li>
</ul>

While you're here, come on in. Fancy something neat, I'm your guy.
