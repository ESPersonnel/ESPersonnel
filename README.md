### ESPersonnel here 👋

I'm a 3D artist. I'm here to showcase my learning experiences.

Currently working on learning Three.JS ('It's not that bad')

I'll be sharing my artwork once I get a website built, hence the need for Three.JS.

Here's my portfolio website: <a href="https://github.com/ESPersonnel/ESPersonnel-Portfolio">Portfolio</a>

This is where good sites will be stored:

<ul>
  <li><a href = "https://hello-threejs-seven.vercel.app/">Hello three.js</a> - First site just happens to be a donut, Andrew Price would be so proud (Blender reference).</li>
  <li><a href = "https://galaxy-generator-dun.vercel.app/">Galaxy Generator</a> - This one's a good one. With only animation left, it's got a lot going on for it.</li>
  <li><a href = "https://particles-silk.vercel.app/">Particles</a> - Some of you like math. Well, this is some mouth watering shi- 'language'. It's a wave function. It's all there is to it.</li>
</ul>

Lemme add a few more. I'll do house clean up in a bit.

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/DennohKim/TurfZone/">TurfZone Football App</a> - Had a lot fun working on this in a group setting. Full stack (React + Ruby on Rails)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/Phase-V-Capstone/dashboard">Hackerank Moringa</a> - Currently working on this with a team. Good things are coming.</li>
</ul>

While you're here, come on in. Fancy something neat, I'm your guy.

Here's a little sumn sumn for the stats guys:

The numbers will get there. Gotta start somewhere.
